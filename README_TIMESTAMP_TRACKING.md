# Timestamp Tracking Implementation

This update adds timestamp tracking to prevent re-processing of log entries that have already been processed.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated `FileState` struct** (in `types.go`):
   - Added `LastTimestamp` field to track the timestamp of the last processed log entry
   - Added `LastProcessedIP` field to track the last IP that was processed

2. **Added timestamp extraction** (in `timestamp.go`):
   - Created functions to extract timestamps from Apache and Caddy log formats
   - Added logic to compare timestamps to determine if an entry is newer

3. **Updated `processLogEntry` function** (in `process_log_entry_updated.go`):
   - Now takes a `state` parameter to track timestamps
   - Skips processing if the entry timestamp is older than the last processed timestamp
   - Updates the timestamp in the file state after processing

4. **Updated `readNewContent` function** (in `read_new_content_updated.go`):
   - Now passes the file state to `processLogEntry`

5. **Updated `processLogFile` function** (in `process_log_file_updated.go`):
   - Now passes the file state to `processLogEntry`

## How to Apply These Changes

1. Replace the `FileState` struct in `types.go` with the updated version
2. Add the new `timestamp.go` file
3. Replace the `processLogEntry` function with the version in `process_log_entry_updated.go`
4. Replace the `readNewContent` function with the version in `read_new_content_updated.go`
5. Replace the `processLogFile` function with the version in `process_log_file_updated.go`

## How It Works

1. When a log entry is processed, its timestamp is extracted and compared to the last processed timestamp
2. If the entry is older than the last processed timestamp, it is skipped
3. After processing an entry, the timestamp is stored in the file state
4. This prevents re-processing of entries that have already been seen, even if the file is re-read

## Testing

To test these changes:
1. Enable verbose logging with the `-verbose` flag
2. Check the logs for messages about skipping older entries
3. Verify that the same IP is not repeatedly added to the blocklist

## Limitations

1. This approach relies on log entries having timestamps in a recognizable format
2. If log entries don't have timestamps, they will all be processed
3. If log entries have timestamps in an unexpected format, they will all be processed
