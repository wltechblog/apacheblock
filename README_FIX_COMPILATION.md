# How to Fix Compilation Errors

To fix the compilation errors in the Apache Block project, follow these steps:

## 1. Replace logmonitor.go with the fixed version

```bash
cp logmonitor_fixed.go logmonitor.go
```

This will update the `processLogEntry` function calls to include the `state` parameter.

## 2. Update the FileState struct in types.go

The `FileState` struct in types.go should already have the `LastTimestamp` and `LastProcessedIP` fields. If not, make sure it looks like this:

```go
// FileState tracks the state of a file being monitored
type FileState struct {
    File            *os.File
    Position        int64
    Size            int64
    LastMod         time.Time
    LastTimestamp   time.Time // Timestamp of the last processed log entry
    LastProcessedIP string    // Last IP that was processed
}
```

## 3. Make sure the timestamp.go file exists

The timestamp.go file should contain the functions for extracting and comparing timestamps from log entries.

## 4. Compile the project

```bash
go build
```

This should now compile without errors.

## What was fixed

1. Updated `processLogEntry` function calls in logmonitor.go to include the `state` parameter
2. Added `LastTimestamp` and `LastProcessedIP` fields to the `FileState` struct
3. Created the `timestamp.go` file with timestamp extraction and comparison functions
4. Updated the `handleLogFile` function to initialize the new fields in the `FileState` struct

These changes will prevent re-processing log entries and re-blocking already blocked IPs.
